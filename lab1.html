	<h3> What is HTML? </h3>
	
	<p> 
		HTML stand for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is responsible for displaying webpages. The most <br>
		recent version of HTML currently is HTML5.
	</p>
	
	
	<h3> What is a Web Server? </h3>
	
	<p> 
		A Web Server is a computer connected to internet that has the main purpose of waiting for requests <br>
		from web browsers. Some of these requests include displaying web pages, images, movies, and videos. 
	</p>
	
	
	<h3> What is ARPANET? </h3>
	
	<p> 
		ARPANET, which was created in 1969, was essentially the first version of the internet, which is an <br>
		interconnection of computers communicating using a set of rules. The network was created by ARPA  <br>
		(Advanced Research Projects Agency), who were funded by the USA Department of Defense. Originally, <br>
		ARPANET had four hosts at universities in Western US, and 128 host computers. 
	</p>
	
	
	<h3> What is WWW? </h3>
	
	<p>
		WWW, or the World Wide Web, is a software application that makes use of the internet's vast <br>
		infrastructure and allowed computers to access documents of different kinds all over the interent. <br>
		It was created around 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee while he worked at CERN Nuclear Physics Research Lab <br>
		in Geneva Switzerland. 
	</p>
	
	
	<h3> What is Domain Name? </h3>
	
	<p> 
		Domain name is essentially the name of a website. It is a virtual property that that can be bought <br>
		and owned by people. 
		
		
	<h3> What is http? </h3>
	
	<p>
		http stands for "hypertext transfer protocol," and is a protocol that specifies how web pages are <br>
		delivered. The secure version of http is https, and all protocols are a primary component in URLs. 
	</p>
	
	
	<h3> What is W3C? </h3>
	
	<p>
		W3C, which stands for World Wide Web Consortium. The non-profit organization helped to end the browser <br>
		wars between the Microsoft and Netscape by releasing uniform standards for HTML and other web-related <br>
		technologies. It allowed browsers to work mostly the same way, and helped to mitigate immense competition. <br>
		W3C was created by Tim-Berners and others who helped create WWW. Major corporations like Microsoft and <br>
		Netscape also got seats at the table because their input was important. 
	
	<h3> What is URL? </h3>
	
	<p>
		URL, which stands for Uniform Resource Locator, has three primary components: the how, where, and what. <br>
		The "how" is protocols like http and https that specify how web pages are delivered, as well as others <br>
		such as ftp, which initiate file downloads instead of temporary web page loading. The "where" is usually a <br>
		named address, but can also be a raw numeric IP address, which is the identity number every machine, software, <br>
		or website has. The "what" specifies a specific resource on the server, and also descends into subfolders <br>
		within the web site.
